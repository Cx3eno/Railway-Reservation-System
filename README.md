# Railway-Reservation-System
Built a Railway Reservation System in the 2nd Year (3rd Semester) to showcase the function for the ease of management, booking and monitoring of the railway services. 
Language Used: C/C++
Software: Visual Studio Code
OS: Win 11

In the 3rd semester of the 2nd year, I developed a Railway Reservation System aimed at streamlining railway service management, booking, and monitoring processes. The system was built using C/C++, providing a robust and efficient solution.

Visual Studio Code served as the development environment for this project, ensuring a seamless coding experience. The system was designed to operate on the Windows 11 operating system, offering compatibility and optimal performance.

The Railway Reservation System encompassed essential functionalities such as ticket booking, seat availability checking, passenger information management, and ticket cancellation. The user-friendly interface facilitated ease of use for both passengers and railway staff.

To ensure data integrity and security, the system integrated file handling techniques to store and manage passenger and booking information. Additionally, the system implemented error handling mechanisms to handle exceptional scenarios effectively.

This project allowed me to enhance my programming skills in C/C++ and gain hands-on experience in software development for the railway domain. The Railway Reservation System stands as a testament to my ability to create practical and effective solutions for managing and monitoring railway services efficiently. Through this endeavor, I demonstrated my proficiency in designing user-friendly systems to address real-world challenges in the railway industry.
